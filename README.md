# notes-on-go

A Golang learning journey. Author: Fred Snyder [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_fredsnyder)

The main goal of this project is to create a resource that functions as a reference for myself but hopefully for others as well.

Goals:
- learn and document the learning journey
- share my learning experience, questions, problems, and maybe frustrations
- publish code examples and small Go projects

There is a possibility (a real possibility ;/ ) that you'll encounter a code error or other mistakes, perhaps in the comments or explanations (pull requests are more than welcome). You can copy and modify the examples, do as you see fit. Attribution would be appreciated.

## Repo structure

Language folder
- basic syntax, keywords, etc
- lexical structure, semantics
- more advanced constructs

Tooling folder
- information on building, compiling and testing

Projects folder
- example code and example projects
	+ standard library examples
	+ external libraries/packages
	+ frameworks
