# Static typed

Go is a statically typed language.
- The data type of a variable is static and thus cannot be changed.

Python for example is a dynamically typed language.
- You can dynamically assign and change the data type of a variable.

## Go data types

```
bool        boolean logic       true/false
string      text, characters    "This is a text example"
int         numeric             0, 1, 134, -374
float64     numeric             1.74, 0.007
```
