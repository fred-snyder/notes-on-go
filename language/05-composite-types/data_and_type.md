# Data and Type

## Data

> Programming is all about data. And, therefore: Go is all about type.

Programming is about data because you want to process data. To process data you create logic. You give your code a function.

## Type

Type is the answer to the question: How am I going to represent data in a program. Type is about classifying data into unique and coherent groups. Assigning a type to some data means that data has properties which are similar or are connected together to form a higher level class.

A type defines the set of values and the set of operations that can take place on those values.
- You can assign type based on similar properties. (Numbers, characters)
- You can assign a type to organized properties. (Lists, pairs)
- Or you can assign type to groups of properties. (People, animals)

## Different types

- Primitive data types
- Composite data types (aggregate data type)
