# Go modules

Go mod initializes a Go module. It tells the Go compiler "this is the root of my project" and it is used for dependency management. It replaces the `$GOPATH` workflow. (A single path/location where all Go source code was placed.)

- `go.mod` enables dependency tracking for your code.
- `go.sum` (for "checksum") contains the cryptographic hashes of the specific module versions
- `go.mod and go.sum should be checked into Git`


```bash
# enable dependency tracking for your code by creating a go.mod file
# use a domain/URL that you own
# github or a private domain
go mod init <namespace>
go mod init github.com/kaboomshebang/reponame
go mod init kaboomshebang.com/reponame

# removes unused dependencies
go mod tidy
```

> IMPORTANT: `gopls` (VSCode/Editor language tooling) requires a module at the root of your workspace.

## Do you still need the `GOPATH` environment variable?

`GOPATH` still exists. But the "Go workspace" is not really relevant anymore. Instead you can use Go modules.

```bash
# use go env to check the location of $GOPATH
$ go env GOPATH
# for example: /Users/Username/go
```

## Go workspace
- The GOPATH still exists and on Windows points to the go folder in your home directory
- Older versions of Go had a predefined workspace structure for every project and your GOPATH determined the location of that workspace.
- This structure still exist in your default GOPATH folder
    - bin: contains the binary executables.
        - Where `Go install` outputs it's programs
    - src: contains Go source files.
    - pkg: contains Go package archive

## Go modules

>>> After the introduction of Go modules in Go 1.11, youâ€™re no longer required to store your Go code in the Go workspace

In Go version before 1.11 the convention was to store your code in $GOPATH/src/github.com/yourusername/repo. This workflow is modified when Go modules where introduced.

With Go modules the convention is similar in that `go.mod` points to a repo or a URL that is owned by the developer.
